## 💡 Inspiration
Leaving your pets behind when you go for a little trip can be stressful, and we may even consider cancelling our plans. APP_NAME is here to solve this problem by allowing you to leave your pets with some of the top hosts in your area while you relax and enjoy your trip! 
Pets can be anyone, a Dog, cat, as well as plants
## 💻 What it does
* APP_NAME is a platform where Pet Owners can hand over their pets to petlovers ensuring that they are healthy and safe while you are away!
* A Pet Owner can choose the best hosts in their area and book them for a specific date and time.
* A Pet Care Taker can accept or reject the request from pet owners as per their convenience.
* To become a Pet Care Taker, they have to be approved by admin by filling a detailed form.
* A Pet Owner can chat and pay to the Pet Care Taker once the job is completed!
* It also has a Pet Lover Zone where users can add their pets photos for fun!
